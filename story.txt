Neville is a normal man. 
He works as a software developer for the multinational company <?? Company name ??>.
Neville wakes up every morning at 06:30, pours himself a cup of tea and feeds his cat. 
Nveille's cat is called Neville. 
Neville loves climbing trees and chasing squirrels.
Neville's back garden goes back quite a long way, at the end of which is a forest, which keeps an ample supply of squirrels for Neville to chase. 
The toaster pops and Neville applies a sensible amount of butter and jam to his slice before taking it, his tea and the day's paper to his dining table.
By 08:30 Neville is in his car and on his way into the office. Neville works in a large tower in the middle of a very industrial city. His cubicle is one of many hundreds.
Neville has a picture of Neville pinned to one of the walls of his cubicle. When on his breaks, Neville often gazes at the fluffy ginger fur of Neville and smiles to himself. 
But today, Neville had no reason to smile.
